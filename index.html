<h1>Diwali is celebrated every year as in Southern India Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In northern India, they celebrate the story of King Rama's return to Ayodhya after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps.
</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Let's celebrate the festival in the true sense by spreading joy and light up the world of others. Have a happy, safe and blessed Diwali!</h2>
